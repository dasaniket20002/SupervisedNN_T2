# SupervisedNN_T2
Attempt to create a Neural Network in Java

# NeuralNetwork.java
The constructor takes in the number of nodes in each layer of the network. Number of layers can be any integer value. <br>
The first value in the constructor is interpreted as the number of input nodes.<br>
The last value in the constructor is interpreted as the number of output nodes.<br>
All the other middle layers are the number of hidden nodes in each hidden layers.<br>
<br>
*void feed_forward()* function predicts the output based on the input.<br>
*void backpropagation()* tries to compute the errors and adjust the weights and biases accordingly.<br>

# _Info.txt_
File that holds <br>
the total number of layers (i.e., 1st value in file), <br>
the number of nodes in each of those layers thereafter.

# _Weights.txt_ and _Biases.txt_
Computed weights and biases according to the training data, generated by the backpropagation algorithm.<br>
Training the model further will result in modification of this file.<br>
Moreover, these values are loaded in the weight and bias matrices while predicting any output.
